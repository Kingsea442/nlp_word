Millions of Americans and foreigners see G. I. Joe as a mindless war toy, the symbol of American military adventurism, but that’s not how it used to be. To the men and women who <mark>1</mark> in World War II and the people they liberated, the G. I. was the<mark>2</mark>  man grown into hero, the poor farm kid torn away from his home, the guy who <mark>3</mark> all the burdens of battle, who slept in cold foxholes, who went without the   <mark>4</mark>    of food and shelter, who stuck it out and drove back the Nazi reign of murder. This was not a volunteer soldier, not someone well paid,  <mark>5</mark>   an average guy, up   <mark>6</mark>    the best trained, best equipped, fiercest, most brutal enemies seen in centuries.
   His name is not much. G. I. is just a military abbreviation  <mark>7</mark>  Government Issue, and it was on all of the articles  <mark>8</mark>  to soldiers. And Joe? A common name for a guy who never   <mark>9</mark>   it to the top. Joe Blow, Joe Palooka, Joe Magrac … a working class name. The United States has   <mark>10</mark>   had a president or vice-president or secretary of state Joe.
   G. I. Joe had a  <mark>11</mark>   career fighting German, Japanese, and Korean troops. He appears as a character, or a <mark>12</mark> of American personalities, in the 1945 movie The Story of G. I. Joe, based on the last days of war correspondent Ernie Pyle. Some of the soldiers Pyle    <mark>13</mark>    portrayed themselves in the film. Pyle was famous for covering the   <mark>14</mark>    side of the war, writing about the dirt-snow-and-mud soldiers, not how many miles were  <mark>15</mark>   or what towns were captured or liberated. His reports    <mark>16</mark>    the “Willie” cartoons of famed Stars and Stripes artist Bill Maulden. Both men    <mark>17</mark>   the dirt and exhaustion of war, the   <mark>18</mark>    of civilization that the soldiers shared with each other and the civilians: coffee, tobacco, whiskey, shelter, sleep.   <mark>19</mark>  Egypt, France, and a dozen more countries, G. I. Joe was any American soldier,  <mark>20</mark>   the most important person in their lives.
