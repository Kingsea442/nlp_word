</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;">Unfortunately, life is not a bed of roses. We are going through life facing sad experiences. Moreover, we are grieving various kinds of loss: a friendship, a romantic relationship or a house. Hard times may hold you down at what usually seems like the most inopportune time, but you should remember that they won’t last forever.</span>
</p>
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When our time of mourning is over, we press forward, stronger with a greater understanding and respect for life. Furthermore, these losses make us mature and eventually move us toward future opportunities for growth and happiness. I want to share these ten old truths I’ve learned along the way.</span><br />

<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fear is both useful and harmful. This normal human reaction is used to protect us by signaling danger and preparing us to deal with it. Unfortunately, people create inner barriers with a help of exaggerating fears. My favorite actor Will Smith once said, “Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice.” I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant imagination.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;42. <u style="white-space:normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</u></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;If you are surrounded by problems and cannot stop thinking about the past, try to focus on the present moment. Many of us are weighed down by the past or anxious about the future. You may feel guilty over your past, but you are poisoning the present with the things and circumstances you cannot change. Value the present moment and remember how fortunate you are to be alive. Enjoy the beauty of the world around and keep the eyes open to see the possibilities before you. Happiness is not a point of future and not a moment from the past, but a mindset that can be designed into the present.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;43. <u style="white-space:normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</u></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it is easy to feel bad because you are going through tough times. You can be easily caught up by life problems that you forget to pause and appreciate the things you have. Only strong people prefer to smile and value their life instead of crying and complaining about something.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;44. <u style="white-space:normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</u></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how isolated you might feel and how serious the situation is, you should always remember that you are not alone. Try to keep in mind that almost everyone respects and wants to help you if you are trying to make a good change in your life, especially your dearest and nearest people. You may have a circle of friends who provide constant good humor, help and companionship. If you have no friends or relatives, try to participate in several online communities, full of people who are always willing to share advice and encouragement.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;45. <u style="white-space:normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</u></span><br />
<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:14px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Today many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion and seek balance by gaining objectivity from external sources. This way you devalue your opinion and show that you are incapable of managing your own life. When you are struggling to achieve something important you should believe in yourself and be sure that your decision is the best. You live in your skin, think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own choices.</span><br />
