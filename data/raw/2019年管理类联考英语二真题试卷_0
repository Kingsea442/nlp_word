　　Weighing yourself regularly is a wonderful way to stay aware of any significant weight fluctuations. <mark>  1 </mark>, when done too often, this habit can sometimes hurt more than it <mark>  2 </mark>.
　　As for me, weighing myself every day caused me to shift my focus from being generally healthy and physically active to focusing<mark>  3 </mark> on the scale. That was bad to my overall fitness goals. I had gained weight in the form of muscle mass, but thinking only of<mark>  4 </mark>the number on the scale, I altered my training program. That conflicted with how I needed to train to<mark>  5 </mark>my goals.
　　I also found weighing myself daily did not provide an accurate <mark>  6 </mark>of the hard work and progress I was making in the gym. It takes about three weeks to a month to notice significant changes in weight<mark>  7 </mark> altering your training program. The most<mark>  8 </mark> changes will be observed in skill level, strength and inches lost.
　　For these <mark>  9 </mark>, I stopped weighing myself every day and switched to a bimonthly weighing schedule <mark>  10 </mark>. Since weight loss is not my goal, it is less important for me to<mark>  11 </mark> my weight each week. Weighing every other week allows me to observe and <mark>  12 </mark>any significant weight changes. That tells me whether I need to <mark>  13 </mark> my training program.
　　I also use my bimonthly weigh-in <mark>  14 </mark>to get information about my nutrition as well. If my training intensity remains the same, but I’m constantly <mark>  15 </mark> and dropping weight, this is a <mark>  16 </mark> that I need to increase my daily caloric intake.
　　The<mark>  17 </mark>to stop weighing myself every day has done wonders for my overall health, fitness and well-being. I am experiencing increased zeal for working out since I no longer carry the burden of a <mark>  18 </mark> morning weigh-in. I’ve also experienced greater success in achieving my specific fitness goals, <mark>  19 </mark> I’m training according to those goals, instead of numbers on a scale.
　　Rather than <mark>  20 </mark> over the scale, turn your focus to how you look, feel, how your clothes fit and your overall energy level.
