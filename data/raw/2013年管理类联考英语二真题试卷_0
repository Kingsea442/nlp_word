　　Given the advantages of electronic money, you might think that we would move quickly to the cashless society in which all payments are made electronically. <mark>1</mark>  , a true cashless society is probably not around the corner. Indeed, predictions have been  <mark>2</mark>  for two decades but have not yet come to fruition. For example, Business Week predicted in 1975 that electronic means of payment would soon "revolutionize the very <mark>3</mark>  of money itself," only to <mark>4</mark> itself several years later. Why has the movement to a cashless society been so  <mark>5</mark>  in coming?
　　Although electronic means of payment may be more efficient than a payments system based on paper, several factors work  <mark>6</mark>  the disappearance of the paper system. First, it is very  <mark>7</mark> to set up the computer, card reader, and telecommunications networks necessary to make electronic money the  <mark>8</mark>  form of payment. Second, paper checks have the advantage that they  <mark>9</mark>  receipts, something that many consumers are unwilling to  <mark>10</mark> . Third, the use of paper checks gives consumers several days of "float"—it takes several days  <mark>11</mark>  a check is cashed and funds are <mark>12</mark>  from the issuer's account, which means that the writer of the check can earn interest on the funds in the meantime. <mark>13</mark> electronic payments are immediate, they eliminate the float for the consumer. 
　　Fourth, electronic means of payment  <mark>14</mark>  security and privacy concerns. We often hear media reports that an unauthorized hacker has been able to access a computer database and to alter information <mark>15</mark> there. The fact that this is not an <mark>16</mark> occurrence means that dishonest persons might be able to access bank accounts in electronic payments systems and  <mark>17</mark>  from someone else's accounts. The<mark>18</mark> of this type of fraud is no easy task, and a new field of computer science is developing to  <mark>19</mark>  security issues. A further concern is that the use of electronic means of payment leaves an electronic  <mark>20</mark>  that contains a large amount of personal data on buying habits. There are concerns that government, employers, and marketers might be able to access these data, thereby encroaching on our privacy.
