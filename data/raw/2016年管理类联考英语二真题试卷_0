　　Happy people work differently. They’re more productive, more creative, and willing to take greater risks. And new research suggest that happiness might influence  <mark>1</mark>  firms work, too.
　　Companies located in places with happier people invest more, according to a recent research paper. <mark>2</mark>, firms in happy places spend more on R&D ( research and development ). That’s because happiness is linked to the kind of longer-term thinking <mark>3</mark>for making investments for the future.
　　The researchers wanted to know if the   <mark>4</mark>and inclination for risk-taking that come with happiness would   <mark>5</mark> the way companies invested. So they compared U.S. cities’ average happiness <mark>6</mark> by Gallup polling with the investment activity of publicly traded firms in those areas.
　　<mark>7</mark>enough, firms’ investment and R&D intensity were correlated with the happiness of the area in which they were <mark>8</mark>.But is it really happiness that’s linked to investment, or could something else about happier cities <mark>9</mark>why firms there spend more on R&D? To find out, the researchers controlled for various  <mark>10</mark> that might make firms more likely to invest——like size, industry, and sales——and for indicators that a place was<mark>11</mark>to live in, like growth in wages or population. The link between happiness and investment generally <mark>12</mark> even after accounting for these things.
　　The correlation between happiness and investment was particularly strong for younger firms, which the authors  <mark>13</mark>to “less codified decision making process” and the possible presence of “younger and less <mark>14</mark> managers who are more likely to be influenced by sentiment.” The relationship was <mark>15</mark> stronger in places where happiness was spread more  <mark>16</mark>.Firms seem to invest more in places where most people are relatively happy, rather than in places with happiness inequality.
　　<mark>17</mark> this doesn’t prove that happiness causes firms to invest more or to take a longer-term view, the authors believe it at least <mark>18</mark>at that possibility. It’s not hard to imagine that local culture and sentiment would help<mark>19</mark>how executives think about the future. “It surely seems plausible that happy people would be more forward-thinking and creative and  <mark>20</mark> R&D more than the average,” said one researcher.
