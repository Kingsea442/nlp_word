　　Why do people read negative Internet comments and do other things that will obviously be painful? Because humans have an inherent need to<mark>1</mark>uncertainty, according to a recent study in Psychological Science. The new research reveals that the need to know is so strong that people will   <mark>2</mark>to satisfy their curiosity even when it is clear the answer will<mark>3</mark>.
　　In a series of four experiments, behavioral scientists at the University of Chicago   and the Wisconsin School of Business tested students' willingness to<mark>4</mark>themselves to unpleasant stimuli in an effort to satisfy curiosity. For one<mark>5</mark>, each  participant was shown a pile of pens that the researcher claimed were from a previous experiment. The twist? Half of the pens would<mark>6</mark>an electric shock when clicked.
　　Twenty-seven students were told which pens were electrified; another twenty-seven were told only that some were electrified<mark>7</mark>left alone in the room, the students who did not know which ones would shock them clicked more pens and incurred more shocks than the students who knew what would<mark>8</mark>. Subsequent experiments reproduced this effect with other stimuli,<mark>9</mark>the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard and photographs of disgusting insects.
　　The drive to<mark>10</mark>is deeply rooted in humans, much the same as the basic drives for<mark>11</mark>or shelter, says Christopher Hsee of the University of Chicago. Curiosity is often considered a good instinct—it can<mark>12</mark> new scientific advances, for instance—but sometimes such<mark>13</mark>can backfire. The insight that curiosity can drive you to do<mark>14</mark>things is a profound one.
　　Unhealthy curiosity is possible to<mark>15</mark>,however. In a final experiment , participants who were encouraged to<mark>16</mark>how they would feel after viewing an unpleasant picture were less likely to<mark>17</mark>to see such an image. These results suggest that imagining the<mark>18</mark>of following through on one's curiosity ahead of time can help determine <mark>19</mark>it is worth the endeavor. Thinking about long-term<mark>20</mark>is key to reducing the possible negative effects of curiosity." Hsee says. In other words, don't read online comments.
