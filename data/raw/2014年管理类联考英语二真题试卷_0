   Thinner isn't always better. A number of studies have <mark>1</mark> that normal-weight people are in fact at higher risk of some diseases compared to those who are overweight. And there are health conditions for which being overweight is actually <mark>2</mark>. For example, heavier women are less likely to develop calcium deficiency than thin women.<mark>3</mark>, among the elderly, being somewhat overweight is often an<mark>4</mark>of good health.
   Of even greater<mark>5</mark>is the fact that obesity turns out to be very difficult to define. It is often defined <mark>6</mark>body mass index, or BMI. BMI<mark>7</mark>body mass divided by the square of height. An adult with a BMI of 18 to 25 is often considered to be normal weight. Between 25 and 30 is overweight. And over 30 is considered obese. Obesity, <mark>8</mark>,can be divided into moderately obese, severely obese, and very severely obese.
   While such numerical standards seem <mark>9</mark>, they are not. Obesity is probably less a matter of weight than body fat. Some people with a high BMI are in fact extremely fit, <mark>10</mark>others with a low BMI may be in poor <mark>11</mark>.For example, many collegiate and professional football players<mark>12</mark>as obese, though their percentage body fat is low. Conversely, someone with a small frame may have high body fat but a <mark>13</mark>BMI.
   Today we have a(an) <mark>14</mark>to label obesity as a disgrace.The overweight are sometimes <mark>15</mark>in the media with their faces covered. Stereotypes<mark>16</mark>with obesity include laziness, lack of will power, and lower prospects for success.

   Negative attitudes toward obesity, <mark>18</mark>in health concerns, have stimulated a number of anti-obesity  <mark>19</mark>.My own hospital system has banned sugary drinks from its facilities. Many employers have instituted weight loss and fitness initiatives. Michelle Obama has launched a high-visibility campaign  <mark>20</mark>childhood obesity, even claiming that it represents our greatest national security threat.
