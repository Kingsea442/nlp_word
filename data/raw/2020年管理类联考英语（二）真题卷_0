Being a good parent is, of course, what every parent would like to be. But defining what it means to be a good parent is undoubtedly very <mark>1</mark> particularly since children respond differently to the same style of parenting. A calm, rule- following child might respond better to a different sort of parenting than,  <mark>2</mark>  , a younger sibling.
 <mark>3</mark> , there is another sort of parent thatâ€™s a bit easier to  <mark>4</mark>   a patient parent. children of every age benefit from parent parenting. Still,   <mark>5</mark> every parent would like to be parent, this is no easy  <mark>6</mark>. Sometimes parents get exhausted and frustrated and are unable to maintain a  <mark>7</mark>   and composed style with their kids. I understand this.

And then the   <mark>9</mark>  happens: you lose your patience and either scream at your kids or say something that was a bit too  <mark>10</mark>  and dose nobody any good. You wish that you could    <mark>11</mark>  the clock and start over. We have all been there.

This may not only do damage to your relationship with your child but also    <mark>14</mark>  your child's self- esteem.
If you consistently lose your  <mark>15</mark> with your kids, then you are inadvertently modeling a lack of emotional control for your kids. We are all becoming increasingly aware of the   <mark>16</mark> of modeling tolerance and patience for the younger generation. This is a skill that will help them throughout life. In fact, the ability to emotionally regulate or maintain emotional control when  <mark>17</mark>  by stress is one of the most important of all life's kills.
Certainly, it's incredibly  <mark>18</mark>  to maintain patience at all times with your children. A more practical goal is to try, to the best of your ability, to be as tolerant and composed as you can when faced with   <mark>19</mark>   situations involving your children. I can promise you this: As a result of working toward this goal, you and your children will benefit and   <mark>20</mark> from stress from moments, feeling better physically and emotionally.
