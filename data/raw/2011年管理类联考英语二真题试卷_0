The Internet affords anonymity to its users, a blessing to privacy and freedom of speech. But that very anonymity is also behind the explosion of cyber-crime that has<mark>1</mark>across the Web.
   Can privacy  be  preserved  <mark>2</mark>    bringing  safety  and  security  to  a world  that  seems  increasingly   <mark>3</mark> ?
Last month, Howard Schmidt, the nation’s cyber-czar, offered the federal government a    <mark>4</mark>    to make the Web a safer place—a “voluntary trusted identity” system that would be the high-tech   <mark>5</mark>     of a physical key, a fingerprint and a photo ID card, all rolled    <mark>6</mark>    one. The system might use a smart identity card, or a digital credential   <mark>7</mark>    to a specific computer, and would authenticate users at a range of online services.
   The idea is to    <mark>8</mark>   a federation of private online identity systems. Users could    <mark>9</mark>   which system to join, and only registered users whose identities have been authenticated could navigate those systems. The approach contrasts with one that would require an Internet driver’s license    <mark>10</mark>   by the government.
   Google and Microsoft are among companies that already have these “single sign-on” systems that make it possible for users to   <mark>11</mark>    just once but use many different services.
   <mark>12</mark>  , the approach would create a “walled garden” in cyberspace, with safe “neighborhoods” and bright “streetlights” to establish a sense of a   <mark>13</mark>   community.
   Mr. Schmidt described it as a “voluntary ecosystem” in which “individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with   <mark>14</mark>   , trusting the identities of each other and the identities of the infrastructure    <mark>15</mark>    which the transaction runs”.
   Still, the administration’s plan has   <mark>16</mark>  privacy rights activists. Some applaud the approach; others are concerned. It seems clear that such a scheme is an initiative push toward what would    <mark>17</mark>    be a compulsory Internet “driver’s license” mentality.
   The plan has also been greeted with    <mark>18</mark>   by some computer security experts, who worry that the “voluntary ecosystem” envisioned by Mr. Schmidt would still leave much of the Internet    <mark>19</mark> . They argue that all Internet users should be  <mark>20</mark>  to register and identify themselves, in the same way that drivers must be licensed to drive on public roads.
