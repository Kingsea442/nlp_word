　　People have speculated for centuries about a future without work. Today is no different, with academics, writers, and activists once again <mark>1</mark> that technology is replacing human workers. Some imagine that the coming work-free world will be defined by <mark>2</mark>. A few wealthy people will own all the capital, and the masses will struggle in an impoverished wasteland.
　　A different and not mutually exclusive <mark>3</mark> holds that the future will be a wasteland of a different sort, one <mark>4</mark> by purposelessness: Without jobs to give their lives <mark>5</mark> , people will simply become lazy and depressed. <mark>6</mark> , today’s unemployed don’t seem to be having a great time. One Gallup poll found that 20 percent of Americans who have been unemployed for at least a year report having depression, double the rate for <mark>7</mark> Americans. Also, some research suggests that the <mark>8</mark> for rising rates of mortality, mental-health problems, and addiction <mark>9</mark> poorly-educated, middle-aged people is a shortage of well-paid jobs. Perhaps this is why many <mark>10</mark> the agonizing dullness of a jobless future.
　　But it doesn’t <mark>11</mark> follow from findings like these that a world without work would be filled with unease. Such visions are based on the <mark>12</mark> of being unemployed in a society built on the concept of employment. In the <mark>13</mark> of work, a society designed with other ends in mind could <mark>14</mark> strikingly different circumstances for the future of labor and leisure. Today, the <mark>15</mark> of work may be a bit overblown. “Many jobs are boring, degrading, unhealthy, and a waste of human potential,” says John Danaher, a lecturer at the National University of Ireland in Galway.
　　These days, because leisure time is relatively <mark>16</mark> for most workers, people use their free time to counterbalance the intellectual and emotional <mark>17</mark> of their jobs. “When I come home from a hard day’s work, I often feel <mark>18</mark> ,” Danaher says, adding, “In a world in which I don’t have to work, I might feel rather different”—perhaps different enough to throw himself <mark>19</mark> a hobby or a passion project with the intensity usually reserved for <mark>20</mark> matters.
